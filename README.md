# 2D-Wave-Defense
 TL;DR: All of my previous work was lost due to a hard drive failure and a lack of backups, so I've taken the chance to learn to use git as I rewrite one of my most worked on / favourite projects, a 2D platformer. If whoever's reading this is reading it for my computer engineering program admission, I hope this helps prove that I am willing to put in the work for the program, and I hope you have a wonderful day either way.



In my application for a computer engineering program, I was hoping to submit many of my projects, specifically highligting a game I had worked on and off on for about 2 years. Unfortuneately, due to a catastrophic hard drive failure, combined with a lack of backups (personal project), meant that basically all of my work on it was basically rendered non-existant. I unfortuneately only realized this at the last possible moment, the day the application was due. Well, this gives me the opportunity to do something that I've wanted to do for a while - a complete rewrite of one of my oldest and most worked on projects - a 2d game I wrote in python. The objectives with the project are many; I hope to have some work to show the arbiter in my computer engineering program admission, to fix up and imporve all the inefficiencies and problems in the original program, to refresh myself on OOP and C, and most importantly, to make myself familiar with version control and github so that I don't lose all my work ever again.



Major Steps:

    1.  Setup github repository and link it to VScode - DONE

    2.  Setup classes for various entities in the game (player, enemies, etc.) and for the world collision objects

    3.  Setup a camera that will center on the player naturally
    
    4.  Setup classes that will allow for more interaction than just physical obstacles and enemies (attacks, context sensitive objects, etc)
    
    5.  Add a few procedurally generated effects (Dust, explosions, etc)
    
    6.  Add a room/level system that allows for seperation of different areas of the game world (Make it so that the input format is easily modifiable (last time I did it through an image file but there must be a better way))
    

    
    And onwards, just keep expanding on it.
